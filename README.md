# Fake News Detection System using BERT with RAG

This repository contains a comprehensive fake news detection system that combines modern NLP techniques, embeddings, and BERT models to evaluate the truthfulness of claims.

## üîç Overview

The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to fact-check claims:

1. **Web Search**: Retrieves relevant articles using Google Search API
2. **Embedding-based Similarity**: Pre-filters content using semantic embeddings
3. **FAISS Vector Search**: Efficiently finds the most similar documents
4. **BERT-based Fact Checking**: Uses a fine-tuned BERT model for fact-checking and verdict generation
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects emotional manipulation in claims

## üõ†Ô∏è System Components

### 1. WebSearchEngine
Retrieves articles from the web using the Google Custom Search API.

### 2. EmbeddingEngine
Creates vector embeddings for text using SentenceTransformer models and calculates similarity.

### 3. FAISSIndexer
Enables efficient similarity search with Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS).

### 4. BERTFactChecker
Uses a fine-tuned BERT model to perform sophisticated fact-checking on claims against evidence.

### 5. SentimentAnalyzer
Analyzes emotional content to detect potential manipulation.

### 6. FakeNewsDetectionSystem
Integrates all components into a comprehensive detection system.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

## üì¶ Required Libraries

```
numpy
pandas
requests
scikit-learn
sentence-transformers
transformers
torch
faiss-cpu (or faiss-gpu for GPU support)
nltk
python-dotenv
```

## üîë API Keys and Environment Setup

This system requires the following API keys:
- Google API Key (for web search)
- Google Custom Search Engine ID (CX)
- Hugging Face API Key (for accessing models)

### Getting API Keys

#### Google Search API:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
4. Search for and enable the "Custom Search API"
5. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
6. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
7. Copy your API key

#### Google Custom Search Engine ID:
1. Go to the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a programmable search engine"
3. Configure your search engine (select "Search the entire web" for best results)
4. After creation, find your "Search engine ID" (CX) in the setup page

#### Hugging Face API Key:
1. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Go to your profile and select "Settings"
3. Navigate to "Access Tokens"
4. Click "New token" and create a token with appropriate permissions
5. Copy your token

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```
# Google API Credentials
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GOOGLE_CX=your_google_custom_search_engine_id_here

# Hugging Face API
HF_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here
```

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create and set up your `.env` file as described above

## üíª Usage

### Running with project.py

The main entry point for the project is `project.py`. Run it using:

```bash
python project.py
```

### Command Line Arguments

You can pass claims to check directly as command line arguments:

```bash
# Check a specific claim
python projects.py --claim "COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips for tracking people"

# Use verbose mode for additional logging
python projects.py --claim "The Earth is flat" --verbose

# Save results to a file
python projects.py --claim "Drinking coffee reduces risk of heart disease" --output results.json
```

### Using as a Library

```python
from fake_news_detector import FakeNewsDetectionSystem

# Initialize the system
detector = FakeNewsDetectionSystem()

# Analyze a claim
claim = "COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips for tracking people"
result = detector.analyze_claim(claim)

# Print results
if result["status"] == "success":
    print(f"Claim: {result['claim']}")
    print(f"Fact Check Result: {result['fact_check_result']}")
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. The system searches for relevant articles about the claim
2. It creates embeddings for the articles and the claim
3. Using FAISS, it retrieves the most similar articles to the claim
4. It analyzes the sentiment of the claim to detect emotional manipulation
5. The BERT model performs fact-checking based on the retrieved articles
6. Results are compiled into a comprehensive analysis

## üìä Example Output

For the claim "COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips for tracking people":

```
=== ANALYSIS RESULTS ===
Claim: COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips for tracking people

Sentiment Analysis:
Emotional Intensity: 0.34
Dominant Emotion: mildly negative
Is Emotionally Charged: False

Fact Check Result:
Verdict: False
Confidence: 95%
Reasoning:
- Step 1: Key entities identified - COVID-19 vaccines, microchips, tracking people
- Step 2: None of the evidence supports the claim that vaccines contain microchips
- Step 3: Multiple reputable sources directly contradict the claim
- Step 4: Claim uses fear-inducing language about surveillance
- Step 5: Evidence is sufficient to make a determination
Explanation: The claim that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips is a debunked conspiracy theory. Multiple health authorities and fact-checking organizations have confirmed vaccines do not contain tracking devices.
Sources: [Article 1], [Article 2], [Article 3]

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### API Credentials Issues
- Verify that your `.env` file is in the correct location (root project directory)
- Check that all credentials are correctly copied without extra spaces
- For Google API, make sure you've enabled billing for your project if necessary
- Check API usage quotas if you receive rate limit errors
- For Hugging Face API, verify you have the correct permissions for the models you're accessing

### Model Loading Problems
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for downloading models
- Check your internet connection if model downloads fail
- For GPU usage, verify you have the correct CUDA version installed
