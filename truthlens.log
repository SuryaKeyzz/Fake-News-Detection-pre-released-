2025-04-09 21:38:41,221 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: New images have emerged of one of China¡¯s futuristic fighter jets, a three-engine, tailless flying wing aircraft that Western analysts have dubbed the J-36. It¡¯s unclear when the images, which are taken from a video, were shot, but they appeared on Chinese social media sites on Monday and show the aircraft flying over a highway near the runway of Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the factory in Sichuan province where the new jet is believed to have been made. Images of the J-36 first appeared on Chinese social media late last year, quickly capturing the attention of aircraft enthusiasts and military analysts. More appeared online last month. The jet is thought to be a sixth-generation aircraft, incorporating the latest stealth technology, avionics and powerplant and airframe engineering. Military aviation expert David Cenciotti, a former Italian Air Force officer, said on his website, The Aviationist, that the six-second video gives a close look at the design of the J-36.

China to unveil J-35A stealth fighter jet as air force aims to match US aerial power ¡°The trijet engine arrangement, with two engine intakes under the wings and a dorsally-mounted intake behind the cockpit, is a departure from conventional twin-engine setups seen in many contemporary fighters. This configuration may offer advantages in terms of thrust and redundancy,¡± Cenciotti wrote. He said space on the aircraft¡¯s belly shows room for internal weapons bays that could enable it to carry long-range strike missiles. The J-36 could see China pull even with, or possibly ahead of, the United States in the race to field a sixth-generation fighter. The US military¡¯s fifth-generation jets ¨C the twin-engine F-22 and single-engine F-35 ¨C are generally regarded as the world¡¯s best at the moment, though China also has two fifth-generation models, the J-20 and J-35. Neither of those Chinese jets has proven combat experience and effectiveness like the two US fighters, however. US President Donald Trump announced last month that a contract for the US Air Force¡¯s sixth-generation fighter ¨C dubbed the F-47 ¨C had been awarded to Boeing. Trump said a prototype of the jet had been flying for five years. But a US Air Force announcement of the Boeing contract for the F-47 did not give a timeline for when the jets would be deployable, saying only the contract awarded on March 21 covered ¡°the engineering and manufacturing development phase¡± as well as funds for ¡°a small number of test aircraft for evaluation.¡± While China¡¯s J-36 was dominating military aviation chatter this week, it¡¯s not the only sixth-generation jet that Beijing seems to have in the works.

The People¡¯s Liberation Army (PLA) hasn¡¯t publicly acknowledged the existence of either the J-36 or J-50. But the state-run tabloid Global Times last month ran a story quoting various Chinese military experts as saying the images of the two new aircraft ¡°if authentic,¡± show China is making quick progress on sixth-generation fighter jets. ¡°From a development point of view, China appears to be determined to make explorations on next-generation aviation equipment,¡± Wang Ya¡¯nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, was quoted as saying. It can take years for a fighter jet to go from concept to public introduction, let alone deployment. China¡¯s J-35 was first shown to the public at last November¡¯s Airshow China in Zuhai, but it had been in development for 10 or more years, according to analysts.

2025-04-09 22:39:18,588 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article

South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said.

Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case.

2025-04-10 17:37:58,626 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said. CNN¡¯s Gawon Bae contributed to this report.

Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said.
